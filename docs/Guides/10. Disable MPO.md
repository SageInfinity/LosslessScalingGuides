### Troubleshooting : 
**Start Here:**
1.  Use DDU to completely uninstall GPU drivers, then install the latest version.
2.  Update Windows to the latest version.
3.  Disable overlays (Discord, Steam, RTSS, etc.).
4.  Turn off "Hardware Acceleration" in browsers and "Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling" in Windows settings.

### Disable MPO :
**WARNING:** Editing the registry can break Windows. Proceed with caution.

**Option A - Use NvCleanstall (UI-based tool)**

**Option B - Create a Disable_MPO.reg file**
1.  Open Notepad and paste the following:
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm]
    "OverlayMinFPS"=dword:00000000
    ```
2.  Save the file as `Disable_MPO.reg` (ensure you select "All Files" for the 'Save as type' option).
3.  Double-click the saved file to merge it into the registry.
4.  Restart your PC.

**NOTE:** This may not work on Windows 11 24H2 and newer.

### Re-Enable MPO :
**Option A - Use NvCleanstall (UI-based tool)**

**Option B - Delete the reg key created earlier**

### Conclusion :
**If your system is stable:**
→ Keep MPO enabled for:
*   Low latency
*   Better power efficiency
*   Hardware-Independent Flip

**If you are having issues and have tried everything else:**
→ Disabling MPO is a valid last resort.
