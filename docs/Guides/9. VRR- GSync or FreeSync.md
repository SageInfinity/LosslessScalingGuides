# Guide to Setting Up G-Sync/FreeSync with V-Sync and LSFG

## Understanding VRR Standards

- VESA Adaptive-Sync: An open standard by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), allowing monitors to adjust refresh rates dynamically. Compatible with both AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards.
- AMD FreeSync: AMD’s implementation of Adaptive-Sync, designed for AMD GPUs and FreeSync-compatible monitors. It’s cost-effective due to its open-source nature.
- NVIDIA G-Sync: NVIDIA’s proprietary VRR technology, requiring G-Sync-compatible monitors, often with a dedicated module. It offers optimized performance but at a higher cost.
- G-Sync Compatible: NVIDIA’s certification for Adaptive-Sync monitors that work with NVIDIA GPUs without a G-Sync module, offering a more affordable option.

## Choosing the Right VRR Technology

- NVIDIA GPUs: Use G-Sync or G-Sync Compatible monitors.
- AMD GPUs: Use FreeSync monitors.
- Intel GPUs: Support Adaptive-Sync, compatible with VESA-certified monitors.
- Budget: FreeSync and Adaptive-Sync monitors are generally more affordable than G-Sync monitors.
- Performance: All VRR technologies reduce tearing and stuttering, but G-Sync may offer slight advantages in specific scenarios due to proprietary optimizations.

## Checking Hardware Compatibility
- Before proceeding, verify:
  - Monitor: Supports G-Sync, FreeSync, or Adaptive-Sync (check specifications or use NVIDIA’s G-Sync validator or AMD’s FreeSync checker).
  - Graphics Card: Supports G-Sync (NVIDIA), FreeSync (AMD), or Adaptive-Sync (Intel).
  - Connection: Use DisplayPort 1.2+ or HDMI 2.1 for VRR support.

## Enabling VRR

### For G-Sync:
- Open NVIDIA Control Panel.
- Navigate to "Display" > "Set up G-SYNC."
- Enable G-Sync for fullscreen or windowed modes. For G-Sync Compatible displays, tick "Enable settings for the selected display model."


### For FreeSync:
- Open AMD Radeon Software.
- Go to "Settings" > "Display" > "FreeSync."
- Enable FreeSync.

## Steps:

### Setting Up G-Sync/FreeSync with V-Sync
  V-Sync ensures G-Sync/FreeSync remains active by capping FPS, but it can introduce input lag. Capping FPS at 95% of the monitor’s refresh rate mitigates this.

  - Step 1: Enable G-Sync/FreeSync

    Follow the steps above to enable G-Sync or FreeSync in your graphics card control panel.

  - Step 2: FPS Capping

  The final FPS (after LSFG) should be adjusted to reach approximately 95% (Or use the formula mentioned below) of your monitor’s refresh rate to keep VRR active and minimize input lag.

  Examples:
    - 120 Hz monitor: 114 FPS (120 × 0.95 = 114)
    - 144 Hz monitor: 137 FPS (144 × 0.95 = 136.8, rounded to 137)
    - 165 Hz monitor: 157 FPS (165 × 0.95 = 156.75, rounded to 157)
    - 180 Hz monitor: 171 FPS (180 × 0.95 = 171)
    - 240 Hz monitor: 228 FPS (240 × 0.95 = 228)

> The correct formula for max fps = R - (R * R/3600) ; For user's ease, 95% value is cited in this guide. You can use the R - (R * R/3600) formula, where R = Refresh Rate of your monitor. 

  Use Riva Tuner Statistics Server (RTSS) for precise FPS capping. Refer to : [RTSS - FPS Capping Guide]. In RTSS, right-click the framerate limit area to set a "variable refresh rate cap" (VRR cap).
  Alternatively, use NVIDIA or AMD driver FPS limiters, though they may be less precise. Test different limiters, as effectiveness varies by game.

  - Step 3: Enable V-Sync

  Enable V-Sync via the graphics card control panel (NVIDIA Control Panel or AMD Radeon Software). 
  Ingame VSync gives the maximum latency so, it is advised to turn it off in game and OFF in LS for minimum latency. Only turn it on for particular game engines issues and/or emulators.


  - Step 4: Set Base FPS for LSFG

  Divide the VRR cap by the frame generation multiplier (x2 or x3) to determine the base FPS.

  Examples:
  - For x2 frame generation on a 120 Hz monitor: 114 / 2 = 57 FPS
  - For x3 frame generation on a 120 Hz monitor: 114 / 3 = 38 FPS
  - For x2 frame generation on a 144 Hz monitor: 137 / 2 = 68.5 FPS (round to 68)
  - For x3 frame generation on a 144 Hz monitor: 137 / 3 = 45.67 FPS (round to 45)

> Decimal Multipliers can also be used.

> *These are maximum FPS limits to avoid V-Sync input lag. Lower values can be used if needed.*

  - Step 5: Configure Lossless Scaling

  In Lossless Scaling settings, select "Default Sync" or "V-Sync" as the sync method.
  If V-Sync is enabled in GPU drivers, use "off (allow tearing)" in Lossless Scaling to avoid interference. "Default sync" is generally advised for better compatibility.

### FPS Limiting with "Off (allow tearing)" in Lossless Scaling
  Using the "Off (allow tearing)" sync option in Lossless Scaling allows higher base FPS caps without V-Sync input lag but risks tearing if FPS exceeds the monitor’s refresh rate.

  - Advantages: Higher FPS caps with reduced input lag.
  - Caution: G-Sync/FreeSync only works within the monitor’s refresh rate range. Cap FPS 3-4 below the refresh rate to minimize tearing risks.
  - Examples:
    - For a 120 Hz monitor:
      - Base FPS cap of 58 FPS with x2 frame generation (58 × 2 = 116 FPS)
      - Base FPS cap of 39 FPS with x3 frame generation (39 × 3 = 117 FPS)
    - For a 144 Hz monitor:
      - Base FPS cap of 70 FPS with x2 frame generation (70 × 2 = 140 FPS)
      - Base FPS cap of 47 FPS with x3 frame generation (47 × 3 = 141 FPS)
  - The best cap would still be the final max fps to reach the value R - (R * R)/3600 for all the displays, where R is refresh rate.

## Additional Tips for Optimal Performance

- Monitor Calibration: Calibrate your monitor for optimal visuals, especially with LSFG, as frame generation can affect image quality.
- GPU Load Management: Keep GPU load below 90% when using LSFG to avoid stuttering and input lag. Adjust base FPS accordingly.
- Experiment with FPS Limiters: Test RTSS, NVIDIA, or AMD limiters, as performance varies by game.
- Troubleshooting VRR:
  - Verify monitor and GPU compatibility.
  - Update graphics drivers to the latest version.
  - Ensure VRR is enabled in both the control panel and monitor settings.
  - Use a high-quality DisplayPort 1.2+ or HDMI 2.1 cable.
  - Check for conflicts between in-game and driver V-Sync settings.
