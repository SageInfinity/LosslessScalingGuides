# How to select a secondary GPU for dual GPU setup :

## Pre-requisites 
- Read the [Dual GPU Guide/Overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/losslessscaling/comments/1jtaoau/official_dual_gpu_overview_guide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if not read already.
- Check PSU capacity by selecting your components on [PC Part Picker Website](https://pcpartpicker.com/) and use the [SPL's PSU Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/htmlview) if you want to buy a new one.
- Check your PCIe slot bandwidth/speeds by referring to your motherboard manual. It should be enough for your resolution and framerates/refresh rate of the monitor. Refer this [PCIe Guide](https://sageinfinity.github.io/docs/Guides/PCIe%20Guide) for more info.
- Check if your PC case has enough space for two GPUs (based on the GPU's model - height).

## Selection :
- Confirm your monitor resolution (and the game's resolution, if playing on lower resolution than monitor in windowed/borderless mode).
- Decide an average base FPS over which FG has to be applied.
- Refer to the [Second GPU Max LSFG Capability Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17MIWgCOcvIbezflIzTVX0yfMiPA_nQtHroeXB1eXEfI/htmlview) - the base FPS decided earlier should be around half of the values in the sheet .Factor in around 25% lower performance (fps) for HDR, if applicable.
- Preference: AMD>Nvidia=Intel (not a hard and fast rule).
