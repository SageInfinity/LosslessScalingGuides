## Multi Plane Overlay (MPO) in windows

### What is MPO?
Multi-Plane Overlay (MPO) is a modern hardware feature in Windows 10 and 11 that changes how your computer displays content. It lets the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) offload different UI elements (like games, videos, and overlays) as separate layers to the GPU. Misfucntioning or conflicts with MPO may cause flickers, partial screen freezes, HDR performance loss or incompatibilities, and many other.

**Benefits:**
*   **Better Performance:** No more full-screen compositing.
*   **Lower Latency:** Direct scan-out equals a faster response.
*   **Power Efficient:** Uses GPU display engines instead of processing cores.

### Why is it finicky?
MPO relies on a fragile chain:
Windows → App → GPU Driver → Monitor

If any part of this chain breaks, it can result in flickering, black screens, stutters, and even system crashes.

### How it Works :
1.  **DWM Composition (Legacy)**
    *   Every app draws its content off-screen → The DWM pastes it into a final desktop image → The GPU displays it.
    *   This results in high latency and memory usage.
2.  **Flip Presentation Model**
    *   The app tells the DWM where its frame is located → The DWM "flips" to it.
    *   This is faster and is used in modern windowed games.
3.  **Multi-Plane Overlay (MPO)**
    *   Multiple "planes" (game, video, overlay) are sent directly to the GPU's display controller.
    *   The final image is assembled in hardware during scan-out.

### Analogy :
*   **Legacy DWM:** Scanning a finished collage.
*   **MPO:** Scanning stacked, transparent layers.

### Influencing Factors :
1.  **Windows & WDDM**
    *   **Windows 10:** Stable but can be buggy.
    *   **Windows 11:** Deeply tied to MPO (e.g., AutoHDR, Optimized Windowed Mode).
    *   Newer builds like 24H2 have known MPO bugs.
2.  **GPU Drivers**
    *   **NVIDIA:** Can cause flickering in Chrome and games (especially on pre-RTX cards).
    *   **AMD:** Can cause black screens and driver resets (common on 5000/6000/7000 series).
    *   Driver updates are critical.
3.  **Monitors & Connectivity**
    *   High refresh rates (144Hz+), VRR (G-Sync/FreeSync), and HDR add complexity.
    *   Multi-monitor setups place massive stress on MPO.
    *   **DisplayPort & HDMI:** Bandwidth matters more than the specific format.
4.  **HDR & AutoHDR**
    *   MPO must handle SDR and HDR content together.
    *   Some features (e.g., RTX HDR) may automatically disable MPO.
5.  **Overlays**
    *   Discord, Steam, Xbox Game Bar, and RTSS all create new planes.
    *   Poorly coded overlays can break MPO, causing a fallback to legacy composition.

### Common Issues :
Symptoms that MPO might cause:
*   **Screen Flickering:** Especially when hovering over elements or videos.
*   **Black Screens:** Temporary signal dropouts.
*   **Micro-stutters:** Choppy visuals despite a high FPS.
*   **Artifacts:** Glitched text or a blurry UI.
*   **Driver Crashes:** Can be logged in the Event Viewer.

### Troubleshooting : 
**Start Here:**
1.  Use DDU to completely uninstall GPU drivers, then install the latest version.
2.  Update Windows to the latest version.
3.  Disable overlays (Discord, Steam, RTSS, etc.).
4.  Turn off "Hardware Acceleration" in browsers and "Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling" in Windows settings.

### Disable MPO :
**WARNING:** Editing the registry can break Windows. Proceed with caution.

**Option A - Use NvCleanstall (UI-based tool)**

**Option B - Create a Disable_MPO.reg file**
1.  Open Notepad and paste the following:
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm]
    "OverlayTestMode"=dword:00000005
    ```
2.  Save the file as `Disable_MPO.reg` (ensure you select "All Files" for the 'Save as type' option).
3.  Double-click the saved file to merge it into the registry.
4.  Restart your PC.

**NOTE:** This may not work on Windows 11 24H2 and newer.

### Re-Enable MPO :
**Option A - Use NvCleanstall (UI-based tool)**

**Option B - Create an Enable_MPO.reg file**
1.  Open Notepad and paste the following:
    ```
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm]
    "OverlayTestMode"=-
    ```
2.  Run the file, restart your PC, and you're done.

### Conclusion :
**If your system is stable:**
→ Keep MPO enabled for:
*   Low latency
*   Better power efficiency
*   Hardware-Independent Flip

**If you are having issues and have tried everything else:**
→ Disabling MPO is a valid last resort.
